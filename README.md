# Sequence-tool
In the DNA.txt file input a DNA sequence contain `FASTA` extension. Run the seq.py script - you'll get a length of the sequence, percentage content of bases, complement sequence, reverse sequence, complement and reverse sequence and RNA sequence. The DNA sequence will also be translated into protein sequence and you'll get protein molecular weight, protein aromaticity, protein isoelectric point, protein instability and protein gravy.
