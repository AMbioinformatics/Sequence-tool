# Sequence-tool
In the DNA.txt file input a DNA sequence in FASTA format. Run the seq.py script - you will get a length of the sequence, percentage content of bases, complement sequence, reverse sequence, complement and reverse sequence and RNA sequence. Input DNA sequence will also be translated into protein sequence and you will get protein molecular weight, protein aromaticity, protein isoelectric point, protein instability and protein gravy.
